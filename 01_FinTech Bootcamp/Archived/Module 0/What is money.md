Despite the current fascination with money as a store of value and soceital status; historically, money's first and foremost purpose has been to reduce friction in trade. 

> Money, a commodity accepted by general consent as a medium of exchange. It is the medium in which prices and values are expressed; as currency, it circulates anonymously from person to person and country to country, thus facilitating free trade, and it is the principal measure of wealth.[^1](#1)

As such, it generally has three properties:
> 1. Accepted/Liquid: Market participants generally agree on and accept the form of money that is being used. If they didn't trade wouldn't occur and the primary purpose of money is not served.
> 2. Store of Value: It retains value relative to the goods/services it is used to purchase. A volatile currency/money would serve little purpose as there would be no trust in it's value relative to goods and services. A good money has consistent value by which other goods/services are priced.
> 3. Divisible: It can be divided into smaller units making it easier to price items that don't directly equal each other. In this case, money serves as the medium through which equivalence is found. e.g. 1 cow = 30 dollars, 1 plant = 20 dollas, 1 cow = 2/3 plants
