Wealthfront, founded in 2008 by Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll , is an automated investing platform (or Roboadvisor), that is considered a pioneer in the industry.
Initially named kaChing and positioned as a mutual funds research company the firm rebranded itself as Wealthfront and pivoted to wealth management integrating innovative features like tax-loss harvesting to further optimize client's portfolios.
Since 2008, Wealthfron has gone through 7 rounds of funding, but is not publicly listed and is a small firm with only 250-500 employees. As of 2023, it now oversees more than $50 billion in AUM and is set to grow further by 140% in 2023.

Wealthfront operates as an automated investing platform primarily, but has been slowly adding additional features/products that round out a finacially complete portfolio of accounts. It still is primarily geared towards investing vehicles and those associated account types. 
Robo advisors use sophistacated algorithms to reproduce the analysis conducted by savvy financial professionals, and automats decision making based on that analaysis to manage a portfolio for clients. This innovate approach cuts costs (as it requires fewer human experts to provide the knowledge and help train the algorithms) and allows regular consumers to benfit from these services at a lower total cost.
The downside is the lack of flexibility and direct intervention capable. Addionally, computerized trading algorithms can 
Wealtfront was the first robo-advisor firm when it was founded in 2008, but there are now several competitors in the space with the overall sector being valued at ~ USD 4.1 billion in 2021, and with projected growth of ~30% by 2030.
Given the intrinsic connection to data science (robo adivising is built on sophistacted data alogrithms) and the creation of new investment assets (like BitCoin), robo advisors benefit from advances in either of those two underlying fields. And this trend has played out, with algorithms getting more sophisticated (to includde tax-loss harvesting, goal based optimization, etc) as well as more diverse portfolio types to select from (investiing in blockchain or sustainable funds etc.)
The advances in mobile app and cloud based delivery of content has also made it possbile for these firms to provide their services to users with a user-friendly experience. 
Due to potential distrust in a fully automated management solution, the industry has also started offering hybrid services where instead of a dedicated financial advisor, clients use the robo-advisor and meet with a human on a less frequent basis to get more directional advice on their investing goals.


## Results

>* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
>
>* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
>
>* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Wealthfront has recorded and published it's historical performance numbers since 2012. It claims to have generated 136% time-weighted returns and ~7.8% average annual returns since then on it's riskiest portfolios.

When compared to other firms in the same industry, we see that Wealthfront charges similar fees (0.25%) as most other competitors, beaten out by Chales Schwabb and Vanguard who offer lower rates but a more barebones automated service in hopes of upselling customers to a personalized financial advisor.

As a RoboAdvisor, the primary metrics used to compare firms against each other are:
* Expense fees: Charged by the firm (based on total portfolio size) to manage and grow your wealth.
* Time-Weighted Returns: A way of assessing growth of a portfolio that ignores the timing of inflows/outflows by assigning a periodicity to the duration being evaluated.
* Money-Weighted Returns: A method of assessing growth of a portfolio, accounting for the size and timing of the deposits and withdrawals to the portfolio. 
* Assets under Management: The total wealth being managed by the firm. 





## Recommendations

>* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
>
>* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
>
>* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
>
>* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

The primary issue with Robo advisors, continues to be their inflexibility and the lack of human interaction. With something as personal as finance, individuals are more reassured with a human agent in the equation. This is changing with newer generations who are more comfortable with technology. Furthermore, robo-advisors are largely limited to investment vehicles where algorithms can be leveraged to make informed and sound decisions.
As, the maturity of these companies grows, I think they could branch out into more holistic wealth management. Allowing users to automate financial health from paycheck to retirement account. Automated budgeting tools to help users understand their finances, set and achieve goals, while providing a holistic view of their potential options as their wealth grows would allow firms to offer a much more diverse set of features. 

And the best part of this is, no new technology would be required. Instead existing technologies could be leveraged to expand the suite of services offered. Legal and Product work would be required to set up the firm to offer those account types and services. Being a financial planner is different from acting as a fiduciary, which is different from offering from offering banking services. 
Currently, users have to specify and direct their moneys to a portfolio and select a risk allocation they would be comfortable with before the robo-advisor starts managing the money. Imagine instead, where a regularly funded checking account is automatically split into savings, investing and emergency fund accounts, each of which is managed according to that accounts financial objectives and time-horizons. As wealth grows, lines of credits against the assets can be offered to create a self-sustaining cycle of wealth. 

Additionally, there are advancements happening in the fields of Finance and AI, that also position robo-advisory for massive changes. The introduction of GenAI means that previously dry and robotic computer agents can now interact more fluidly with users in natural language. This introduces the potential of real human like interaction with the services managing your money. Finacial instruments are also evolving with new funds focused on sustainable investment or in new products like NFT/blockchain. Creating accounts that invest in these assets provide an additional source of diversification.
This allows robo-advisors to attract more deposit income and increase the LTV of a single customer. By offering the basic financial accounts required to operate and build wealth, we're disincentivizing investing in other platforms.
